# CS50-GameDev
This repository holds my assignments done for the HarvardX course CS50's Introduction to Game Development.

## Important Note
Please don't just copy my code and use it for your submission, you will not learn anything doing that. Just take it as a guidance if your stuck or feel free to compare your solution to mine and maybe find some improvements on either side :-)
